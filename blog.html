			<p>I have recently starting blogging, in the attempt to further express my passion for particular subject areas.</p>
			<p>One such area of interest, and the topic i'm most passionate about is food. I love anything and everything to do within the topic of food. It is interesting to see, how the same ingredients in two different parts of the world, can result in two completely different dishes. It just goes to show how fascinating it is. People have different cooking styles and cultural influences, giving food it's own unique taste and flavours.</p>
			<p>I also enjoy cooking and experimenting with different flavours and ingredients. I will be in the kitchen at home every Friday or Saturday no fail and russell up dinner for the whole family. People soemtimes try to avoid cooking because it is seen as a chore; however I see cooking as an art. I believe there is a vast difference between a cook and a chef. A cook will make food according to set guidelines and/or a recipe, whereas a chef will add his/her flare and creativity to a dish to make it go above and beyond your typical mediocre dish.</p>
			<p>I have recently started as a freelance restaurant critic, reviewing restaurants on TripAdvisor, based on Decor, Service and Food Quality. I began this journey in 2015, and have since then been awarded with many awards and recognition. Currently, I am voted as Top 15% in London, with over 9,100 readers. My current goal is to be in the Top 5% in London.</p>

			<p>I have also recently joined "medium", an online community where I can publish articles about my view points and interests on any topic. My first post was added recently, titled "Super Foods You Didn't Know About..." This article is the first of many which I shall be writing in the near future, discussing some superfoods which people generally do not know exist.</p>
