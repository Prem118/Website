		<h1 align="center"> Current Projects </h1>
			<p>I am currently working on a number of projects, both academic and non-academic.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>I am in the process of creating an interactive website based on myself. Using both HTML and CSS, I intend to create a unique masterpiece that works seamlessly.</p>
			<p>After creating the site, I intend to upload it onto Github, which is a version control system. This will allow me to have the source code on the server, and should I make any adjustments, I can commit the new version. Others also have access to the code, should they want to modify the code in any way; I have the right to accept or reject the updates.</p>
			<p>Another project I am currently working on is GitBash. GitBash is a Unix based command line, which allows you to add/remove directories and files; as well as make changes.</p>
			<p>In the coming weeks, I will be embarking upon many Software Testing projects, which will enable me to perform my role as a tester in a more efficient manner; allowing me to be the best that I can.</p>
			<br>
			<p>In terms of non-academic projects, I am currently in the process of starting a blog about food. Being a foodie and a TripAdvisor critic, I want to start blogging to get my name out there, and be known for my restaurant reveiws.</p>
