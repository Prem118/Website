		<h1 align="center"> Interests </h1>

			<p>This page gives you an overview of the interests that I have, which make me unique to other people. The content will be brief but fully explained. Should you require more information about me, you can visit the <a href="C:\Users\Tech-H05\Desktop\Website\contact.html"> contact page</a>, where you can message me with your query.</p>

			<p>I am an active individual and enjoy playing cricket, as well as taking part in other activities.</p>
			
			<p>I have a strong passion for cooking as well as tying new foods; at home, markets and in restaurants. I am a freelance restaurant critic by night, writing reviews on restaurants within the country. I am currently voted as Top 15% in London with over 9,100 readers. I also enjoy the occasional drink, sampling new drinks and attempting to figure out the flavours and aromatic notes that I can find against my pallete. This keeps my pallette updated with latest flavour combinations, as well as matching food to beverages.</p>

			<p>I have a keen interest in staying up to date with latest technology from new products being released and what ideas are currently in design stage. This is done by constantly googling new technologies as well as reading up on blogs, reading discussions on current affairs. My tech interest of go to is the mobile industry. It always amazes me how much mobile technology has evolved over the past years, and it is difficult to predict the future, due to the sheer speed at which it is changing. I remember looking at my Nokia 3210 as a child, and wondering if phones would ever get a colour screen and a camera, let alone web browsing. When 3G data plans first released, I was amazed at how fast paced we are moving; now we have 4G!!</p>

			<p>Like many people, I also enjoy meeting up with friends and family to enjoy quality time; whether it is to watch movies both at home and at the cinema or to have a quiet night in to play games and converse.</p>
